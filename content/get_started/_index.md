Welcome aboard! ðŸš€ 

You're just a few steps away from unlocking the power of our library. Whether you're looking to build your first intelligent agent or orchestrate a complex multi-agent system, you've come to the right place.

This guide will walk you through the installation and point you to a collection of examples designed to get you up and running in no time.

## Installation

Getting started is as simple as running a single command. Our library is hosted on PyPI, so you can install it directly using `pip`.

```bash copy
pip install aigency
```

> [!TIP]
> **Pro Tip:** We recommend installing the library in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects.
